#Testing of the application
##What technologies were used to test the application
The application is tested in two distinct ways. Front-end and back-end tests are 
implemented with different technologies. Front-end tests are done with the Jest
testing-framework and complemented with the utility Enzyme for easier testing of
React-components. Back-end tests, as well as UI-tests, are done with RSpec.
For UI-tests we have RSpec use Capybara.
